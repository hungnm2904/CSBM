 Creates an instance of the registered subclass with this class's `PFSubclassing.+parseClassName`.
 
 This helps a subclass ensure that it can be subclassed itself.
 For example, `[PFUser object]` will return a `MyUser` object if `MyUser` is a registered subclass of `PFUser`.
 For this reason, `[MyClass object]` is preferred to `[[MyClass alloc] init]`.
 This method can only be called on subclasses which conform to `PFSubclassing`.
